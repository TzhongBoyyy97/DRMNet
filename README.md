# Domain Generalization for Pulmonary Nodule Detection via Distributionally-Regularized Mamba

This paper has been accepted by MICCAI 2025.

We propose the FASS module to incorporate global features by leveraging the spatial relationship between pulmonary nodules and vascular structures to integrate global features. 

We introduce the RADA module further to align pulmonary nodule features from different source domains, enabling effective generalization to the target domain. 

We construct a domain generalization dataset GPND for pulmonary nodule detection. It contains two private datasets and two public datasets.
